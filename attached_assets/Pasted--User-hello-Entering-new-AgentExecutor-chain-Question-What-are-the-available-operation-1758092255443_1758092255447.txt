Question: What are the available operations for processing a LAS file using MCP server tools?

Thought: I should first check if I have access to the necessary functions to process a LAS file. Since I can create plots and list files, I'll start by checking if I can also perform basic statistics or quality checks on a LAS file.

Action: I will use the `mcp_process_las` function with an empty operation string to see what it does.
